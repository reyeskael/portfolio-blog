We explored famous tourist spots in Taipei, indulged in local cuisine and street food delights.\n\n## Day 1: DIY Adventure\n\nOur first day was a DIY adventure, exploring the city on our own. We visited:\n\n- **Taipei 101** - The iconic skyscraper with breathtaking views\n- **Ximending** - The vibrant shopping district\n- **Night Markets** - Sampling local street food\n\n## Day 2-3: Guided Tours\n\nThe second and third days were guided tours booked through Klook, giving us the perfect mix of spontaneity and convenience.\n\n### Jiufen Old Street\n\nThe famous mountain town that inspired Spirited Away. The narrow alleyways filled with red lanterns created a magical atmosphere.\n\n### Shifen Waterfall\n\nOften called the \"Little Niagara of Taiwan,\" this 20-meter waterfall was absolutely stunning.\n\n## Food Highlights\n\n- Beef noodle soup\n- Bubble tea from the original inventors\n- Xiao long bao (soup dumplings)\n- Mango shaved ice\n\n> Taiwan exceeded all our expectations. The blend of modern city life, traditional culture, and incredible food made it the perfect first international trip.\n\nCan't wait to explore more of Asia!"
