It's often called the \"Playground of the Gods\" due to its mystical sea of clouds.\n\n## The Journey\n\n### Day 1: Travel and Orientation\n\n- Traveled from Manila to Benguet\n- Environmental briefing at the DENR office\n- Stayed at the ranger station\n\n### Day 2: The Summit Assault\n\nWe started our adventure at **1AM** and reached the summit around **9AM**.\n\n#### The Trail (Ambangeg Trail)\n\n- Grassland terrain\n- Mossy forest sections\n- Rocky paths near the summit\n- Total distance: ~9km one way\n\n### The Challenge\n\n- Near-freezing temperatures (around 5°C)\n- Thin air at high altitude\n- Sleep deprivation from the early start\n- Physical exhaustion from the long trek\n\n## The Reward\n\nThe exhausting climb was absolutely worth it when we witnessed the breathtaking view from the top.\n\n### Sea of Clouds\n\n> Standing among the clouds in the Philippines' third highest peak.\n\nWatching the sunrise paint the clouds in shades of orange and gold was a spiritual experience.\n\n## Tips for Future Climbers\n\n1. **Train beforehand** - Build your stamina\n2. **Layer up** - It gets really cold\n3. **Bring headlamps** - You'll be hiking in the dark\n4. **Pack light** - Every gram counts on the trail\n5. **Stay hydrated** - Bring enough water\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nMount Pulag taught me that the best views come after the hardest climbs. Worth every step!"
