She is the last *mambabatok* (traditional Kalinga tattooist) and a living legend.\n\n### The Traditional Method\n\nThe *batok* tattooing method uses:\n\n- A thorn from a pomelo tree as the needle\n- Charcoal mixed with water as ink\n- A wooden stick to tap the thorn into the skin\n\n## Our Tattoo Experience\n\nWe immersed ourselves in their rich culture and had the once-in-a-lifetime experience of getting tattooed by the legendary Apo Whang-od herself.\n\n### The Pain\n\nHonestly? It hurt more than modern tattoo machines. But the cultural significance made every tap worth it.\n\n### The Design\n\nWe got the traditional three-dot pattern, which represents:\n\n- Protection\n- Bravery\n- Connection to the Kalinga heritage\n\n> A trip that left a permanent mark, both on our skin and in our hearts.\n\n## Cultural Immersion\n\n- Stayed overnight in a local homestay\n- Experienced the warm hospitality of the Butbut tribe\n- Learned about their traditions and way of life\n\nThis experience is something I'll treasure forever."
