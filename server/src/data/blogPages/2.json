    "content": "# Starting My Fitness Journey: Boxing & Muay Thai\n\nAs a software engineer, sitting for the majority of my day became the norm. To break this sedentary lifestyle, I enrolled in an MMA gym to learn boxing and muay thai.\n\n## Why Combat Sports?\n\nBeyond staying active, training has become my outlet for releasing stress and clearing my mind. There's something therapeutic about hitting pads after a long day of debugging code.\n\n## What I've Learned\n\n### Boxing Fundamentals\n\n- Proper stance and footwork\n- Jab, cross, hook, and uppercut combinations\n- Defense techniques: slipping, bobbing, and weaving\n\n### Muay Thai Basics\n\n- The art of eight limbs\n- Kicks: roundhouse, teep (push kick)\n- Clinch work and knee strikes\n- Elbow techniques\n\n## The Mental Benefits\n\n1. **Stress Relief** - Nothing clears your mind like focused physical activity\n2. **Discipline** - Showing up consistently, even when tired\n3. **Confidence** - Knowing you can defend yourself\n4. **Community** - Meeting like-minded people at the gym\n\n> It's been an incredible journey of discipline, physical growth, and mental resilience.\n\n## My Routine\n\n- Training 3-4 times per week\n- Mix of technique drills and pad work\n- Occasional sparring sessions\n\nThe journey continues!"
